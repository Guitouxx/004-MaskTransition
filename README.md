This repo includes a code extract of the prototype "Mask Transition" at [https://playgl.xyz/4](https://playgl.xyz/4).

A WEBGL transition between two textures controlled by a mask texture.
I added a little UV offset to emphasize the effect.
Try to resize your viewport to alternate the axis interpolation.

Inspired by the beautiful [Composites website](https://composites.archi)

All prototypes that comes from playgl experiments will be shipped with:
- Threejs  
- Sveltekit  
- Tailwindcss
